  CHANGES IN LDAvis VERSION 0.3.5

NEW FEATURES

Click events (on topics and terms) are now made available to the Shiny input object (closes [[#45]](https://github.com/cpsievert/LDAvis/issues/45)). When a topic is clicked on, the topic number is made available to Shiny server at input$OUTPUTID_topic_click, where OUTPUTID is the outputId of the LDAvis plot. When a term is clicked on, the term is available at input$OUTPUTID_term_click. See https://github.com/cpsievert/LDAvis/tree/master/inst/examples/shiny for an example Shiny app.

BUG FIXES

The jensen-shannon divergence calculated in `jsPCA()` (i.e., the default for the `mds.method` argument in `createJSON`) now does division in log space which is more precies and reduces the probability of underflow (see #80, thanks @dpmccable). It also now checks for 0 values and returns 0 in that case (instead of producing a NaN result, see #56).

If rows of theta/phi don't all sum to 1, a warning is now thrown instead of an error (see #68).

  CHANGES IN LDAvis VERSION 0.3.4

A new argument, encoding, was added to serVis(). This sets the encoding which will be used to write the JSON file. This may be set to `UTF-8` to  fix an issue where, when running on windows, the JSON output would be encoded in ANSI despite the R data beeing encoded in UTF-8. This should also fix #50.

  CHANGES IN LDAvis VERSION 0.3.3

A new argument, reorder.topics, was added to createJSON(). For details, see #51

It is possible to use different language than english in the final visualization (polish so far). See [[#60]](https://github.com/cpsievert/LDAvis/issues/60).

  CHANGES IN LDAvis VERSION 0.3.2
  
BUG FIX

In some cases, the widths of the red topic-term bars did not decrease (as they should have) from term \#1 to term \#R under the relevance ranking with $\lambda = 1$. In other words, when $\lambda = 1$, there were topics in which a narrow red bar was displayed above a wider red bar, which should never happen. The issue had to do with the way topic-term bar widths are computed, and is discussed in detail in #32.

In the end, we implemented a quick fix in which we compute term frequencies implicitly, rather than using those supplied in the createJSON() function. The upside is that the red bar widths are now explicitly controlled to produce the correct visualization. The downside is that the blue bar widths do not necessarily match the user-supplied term frequencies exactly -- in fact, the new version of LDAvis ignores the user-supplied term frequencies entirely. In a few experiments, the differences are small, and decrease (as a proportion of the true term frequencies) as the true term frequencies increase. Thanks to @bmabey for leading us to this bug.
